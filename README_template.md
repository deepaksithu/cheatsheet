Discuss the programs, APIs, libraries, and data sets used. Describe the structure of the data sets as well. With that context, go into the broader 'why' of the project. Then finally explain the project's current status and maintenance._

## Requirements
_List all programs, APIs, and non-csv files used in this project._

This code depends on the following libraries:
1. `pandas`
2. `numpy`
3. `matplotlib.pyplot`
4. `seaborn`

In addition to these, the Jupyter Notebook assumes that the data set from it's source has been downloaded, extracted, and saved as `name_of_data_file.csv`.

The Binder badge above can be used to explore an executable environment for this project. _Note that this template badge links to the Google homepage._

## Features
